      <h2>L3/L4 Projects for students@DU - 2020/2021</h2>
      <p>Welcome to join the Learning Lab! You may choose one of the following projects, or propose your own projects.</p>

          <h4>A Concept Map based Learning Tool to Supports Cognitive Behaviour</h4>
          <p>Concept Mapping has been proven to have a promising impact on learning. Some studies suggest that effective feedback, hyperlinks, expert templates, comparative strategies, etc. may support better learning behaviour. In this project, you will be developing and evaluating a mobile (iOS/Android) or web-based application providing concept mapping facilities that can help students learn more efficiently and effectively.</p>

          <h4>A Web-based System for Explaining Artificial Intelligence</h4>
          <p>Explainable AI (XAI) refers to methods and techniques in the application of Artificial Intelligence such that the results of the solution can be understood and trusted by humans. There is a strong need for quantifiable measurements used by actual humans to assess the interpretability of AI decisions. In this project, you will develop a novel, scalable web-based system that supports the quantifiable assessment of AI Explanations with humans.</p>

          <h4>Games for Learning Machine Learning</h4>
          <p>At present, Machine Learning (ML) is among the most popular modules/courses in many undergraduate programmes in the globe. However, there are many challenges in learning ML. For example, (1) to start learning ML, it is important that a student has essential math knowledge including Equations, Functions, Graphs, Differentiation and Optimisation, Vectors and Matrics, Statistics and Probability and so on; (2) ML processes and many of its algorithms are very complex and abstract, thus in need of good visualisations and explanations; and (3) students normally come with diverse background (knowledge, skills, cognitive preferences) such that the “one-size-fits-all” approach does not really work. In this project, you will develop a digital game to help undergraduate students learn ML. It could be either web-based or mobile-based application. You will also evaluate the application with real users.</p>

          <h4>Intelligent Swarm Robots for Future Classroom</h4>
          <p>Swarm Robotics is an approach to coordinating many simple physical robots which have collective behaviour when interacting with each other and with the environment. In this project, you will develop a collection of small, simple and affordable robots. These robots will be able to work together to demonstrate the different states of matter (solid, liquid, gaseous), so that the students can, e.g. reproduce the behaviour of atoms using the small robots.</p>

          <h4>Deep Learning for Text Summarisation</h4>
          <p>In the era of big data, vast collections of text are generated across the Internet covering content in various domains and topics. However, reading a large number of texts requires a lot of time and effort. People are not able to read through all the information across the Internet. Therefore, being able to summarise text from a long sentence or even paragraph to a more dense version will reduce the amount of time people require to read and understand information. From a machine learning perspective, this can be considered as the final product which has great potential in business value. Importantly, it could potentially be used as a step before using another model on the summarised text which will make it possible for models to be trained with less memory and hence allow easier expression and more efficiency of model training.</p>

          <h4>Self-proposed Projects</h4>
          <p>I am happy to supervise self-proposed projects in the fields of Human-AI Interaction, Behavioural Analytics, Explainable AI, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, Learning Technologies, Interactive Design, Gamification, Open User Modelling. If you have a brilliant idea, please let me know.</p>
