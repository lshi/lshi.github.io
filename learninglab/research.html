                    <br><strong>Human-Centred Design</strong> is an approach to the development of interactive systems, aiming to make systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs and requirements.

                    <br><strong>Cognitive computing</strong> is the use of computerised models to simulate the human thought process in complex situations. It is based on self-learning systems to perform specific, human-like tasks.
                    <br>In the <strong>Learning Lab</strong>, we use gamification techniques built upon cognitive computing, to implement learning systems for users to have effective and immersive learning experiences.</p>

                    <p class="card-text text-justify"><strong>Virtual Reality (VR)</strong> is already available to consumers, but it remains in a niche market. One of the obstacles is the lack of the ability to offer the immersive experience the user expects. We are tackling this challenge by exploring an alternative and novel approach that can prepare in advance natural responses to the user’s action/reaction.
                        <br>In particular, we are training a <strong>Visual Attention Model</strong> using historical data of eye movement associated with virtual space status. This model will then be implemented in the intelligent user interfaces of a virtual museum (VM) based on a head-mounted display (HMD).
                        <br>We aim to enable the HMD-based VM to prepare in advance natural responses by predicting the user’s visual attention using their current eye movement with respect to the exhibits in the VM. Using this approach, we anticipate a high level of immersive user experience.</p>

            <h4>Co-Decision-Making between Humans and Machines</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">How can a small group of humans and machines collaborate in decision making? What mechanisms and frameworks are needed for humans and machines to coordinate their activities and efficiently make decisions? Is it possible to scale up these methods thus supporting massive activities? In this project, we will address these questions by exploring new forms of human-machine interaction and collaboration.</p>

            <h4>Wearable Haptic Technology for Immersive and Interactive Environments</h4>
            <p>Haptic technologies can contribute to improving immersion, interaction and imagination in virtual environments. They offer touch feedback and tactile illusions on interactive virtual systems. In this project, we aim to develop novel and affordable haptic devices, towards enhancing immersion by providing meaningful haptic information that can increase the user's emotional and physiological sensations.</p>

            <h4>A Concept Map based Learning Tool to Supports Cognitive Behaviour</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">Concept Mapping has been proven to have a promising impact on learning. Some studies suggest that effective feedback, hyperlinks, expert templates, comparative strategies, etc. may support better learning behaviour. In this project, you will be developing and evaluating a mobile (iOS/Android) or web-based application providing concept mapping facilities that can help students learn more efficiently and effectively.</p>

            <h4>A Web-based System for Explaining Artificial Intelligence</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">Explainable AI (XAI) refers to methods and techniques in the application of Artificial Intelligence such that the results of the solution can be understood and trusted by humans. There is a strong need for quantifiable measurements used by actual humans to assess the interpretability of AI decisions. In this project, you will develop a novel, scalable web-based system that supports the quantifiable assessment of AI Explanations with humans.</p>

            <h4>Games for Learning Machine Learning</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">At present, Machine Learning (ML) is among the most popular modules/courses in many undergraduate programmes in the globe. However, there are many challenges in learning ML. For example, (1) to start learning ML, it is important that a student has essential math knowledge including Equations, Functions, Graphs, Differentiation and Optimisation, Vectors and Matrics, Statistics and Probability and so on; (2) ML processes and many of its algorithms are very complex and abstract, thus in need of good visualisations and explanations; and (3) students normally come with diverse background (knowledge, skills, cognitive preferences) such that the “one-size-fits-all” approach does not really work. In this project, you will develop a digital game to help undergraduate students learn ML. It could be either web-based or mobile-based application. You will also evaluate the application with real users.</p>

            <h4>Intelligent Swarm Robots for Future Classroom</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">Swarm Robotics is an approach to coordinating many simple physical robots which have collective behaviour when interacting with each other and with the environment. In this project, you will develop a collection of small, simple and affordable robots. These robots will be able to work together to demonstrate the different states of matter (solid, liquid, gaseous), so that the students can, e.g. reproduce the behaviour of atoms using the small robots.</p>

            <h4>Deep Learning for Text Summarisation</strong></h4>
            <p class="text-justify">In the era of big data, vast collections of text are generated across the Internet covering content in various domains and topics. However, reading a large number of texts requires a lot of time and effort. People are not able to read through all the information across the Internet. Therefore, being able to summarise text from a long sentence or even paragraph to a more dense version will reduce the amount of time people require to read and understand information. From a machine learning perspective, this can be considered as the final product which has great potential in business value. Importantly, it could potentially be used as a step before using another model on the summarised text which will make it possible for models to be trained with less memory and hence allow easier expression and more efficiency of model training.</p>
