            <h4>Co-Decision-Making between Humans and Machines</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">How can a small group of humans and machines collaborate in decision making? What mechanisms and frameworks are needed for humans and machines to coordinate their activities and efficiently make decisions? Is it possible to scale up these methods thus supporting massive activities? In this project, we will address these questions by exploring new forms of human-machine interaction and collaboration.</p>

            <h4>Designing Emotional Intervention Mechanisms Towards Ensuring Affective and Cognitive Quality</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">The ultimate goal of this research is to explore and implement emotional intervention mechanisms for ensuring affective and cognitive quality for distance learning that are gamified using game design strategies and game elements, by analysing and mapping relationships between key factors affecting students’ emotions and learning effectiveness, and adaptively generating and delivering personalised learning materials that can intervene students’ emotional state thus ultimately improving learning outcomes.</p>

            <h4>Wearable Haptic Technology for Immersive and Interactive Environments</h4>
            <p>Haptic technologies can contribute to improving immersion, interaction and imagination in virtual environments. They offer tactile feedback and tactile illusions on interactive virtual systems. In this project, we aim to develop novel and affordable haptic devices, towards enhancing immersion by providing meaningful haptic information that can increase the user's emotional and physiological sensations.</p>

            <p>Below are potential L3/L4 projects for Durham UG students.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>Interactive System for XAI</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">Explainable AI (XAI) refers to methods and techniques in the application of Artificial Intelligence such that the results of the solution can be understood and trusted by humans. There is a strong need for quantifiable measurements used by actual humans to assess the interpretability of AI decisions. In this project, you will develop a novel, scalable system (mobile (iOS/Android) or web-based) that supports the quantifiable assessment of AI Explanations with humans.</p>

            <h4>Concept Map to Support Cognitive Behaviour and Behavioural Changes</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">Concept Mapping has been proven to have a promising impact on learning. Some studies suggest that effective feedback, hyperlinks, expert templates, comparative strategies, etc. may support better learning behaviour. In this project, you will be developing and evaluating a mobile (iOS/Android) or web-based application providing concept mapping facilities that can help students learn more efficiently and effectively.</p>

            <h4>Games for Learning Machine Learning</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">At present, Machine Learning (ML) is among the most popular modules/courses in many undergraduate programmes in the globe. However, there are many challenges in learning ML. For example, (1) to start learning ML, it is important that a student has essential math knowledge including Equations, Functions, Graphs, Differentiation and Optimisation, Vectors and ics, Statistics and Probability and so on; (2) ML processes and many of its algorithms are very complex and abstract, thus in need of good visualisations and explanations; and (3) students normally come with diverse background (knowledge, skills, cognitive preferences) such that the “one-size-fits-all” approach does not really work. In this project, you will develop a digital game to help undergraduate students learn ML. It could be either web-based or mobile-based application. You will also evaluate the application with real users.</p>

            <h4>Intelligent Swarm Robots for Future Classroom</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">Swarm Robotics is an approach to coordinating many simple physical robots which have collective behaviour when interacting with each other and with the environment. In this project, you will develop a collection of small, simple and affordable robots. These robots will be able to work together to demonstrate the different states of matter (solid, liquid, gaseous), so that the students can, e.g. reproduce the behaviour of atoms using the small robots.</p>

            <h4>Self-proposed projects are also welcome!</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">If your project is related to Machine Learning, Behavioural Analytics, Recommender Systems, User Modelling, Personalisation, Cognitive Computing, Affective Computing, Gamification, Serious Games, Participatory Design, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, etc., please let us know.</p>
